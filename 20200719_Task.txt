As opposed to HTTP/1.1, which keeps all requests and responses in plain text format, HTTP/2 
uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format, while still 
maintaining HTTP semantics, such as verbs, methods, and headers. 

HTTP/2 came into use, which offered several methods to decrease latency, especially 
when dealing with mobile platforms and server-intensive graphics and videos.

As mentioned in the previous section, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 share semantics, ensuring 
that the requests and responses traveling between the server and client in both protocols 
reach their destinations as traditionally formatted messages with headers and bodies, using 
familiar methods like GET and POST. But while HTTP/1.1 transfers these in plain-text messages, 
HTTP/2 encodes these into binary, allowing for significantly different delivery model possibilities.
